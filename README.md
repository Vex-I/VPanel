# VPanel
The backend for my personal website, featuring a Content Management System and built-in markdown editor.

## Planned Features
---
- Content Management System, spreading content into sections and subsections, all rendered using markdown.
- Customizable tags for each subsection that includes custom topics, excerpts and title styles to be displayed in the view list.
- Authentication.

Main website is deployed at [vex-i.pages.dev](vex-i.pages.dev). Feel free to fork this as neccessary.
