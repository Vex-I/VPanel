# VPanel
The backend for my personal website, featuring a Content Management System and built-in markdown editor.

## Features

- Content Management System, spreading content into sections and subsections, all rendered using markdown.
- Customizable tags for each subsection that includes custom topics, excerpts and title styles to be displayed in the view list.
- Built-in markdown editor that shows how the page would look like in real-time.
- image and markdown plugin support.
- Admin panel locked behind a password.

Main website is deployed at [vex-i.pages.dev](vex-i.pages.dev). Feel free to fork this as neccessary.
